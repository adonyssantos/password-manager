## How it works

- When creating your account, you must use a username or email that is not registered and your master password must contain a minimum of 15 characters, among those characters it must have at least 2 numbers, 2 symbols and 1 capital letter.
- When you create your account a "Default" folder will be created without any password inside, you can start creating all the passwords and folder you want by clicking in the (‚ûï) blue button at the bottom right.
- If you delete a folder with passwords inside, these passwords will be moved to the "Default" folder. Note that the "Default" folder cannot be deleted.
- The user can update the information of a password or folder by clicking on the pencil button (‚úèÔ∏è) that is to the left of each folder or password.
- The user can delete a password or a folder by clicking on the trash button (üóëÔ∏è) that is to the left of each folder or password and it will show you a confirmation dialog. Note that you cannot recover a password or folder once it has been deleted.
- The user's session ends once you exit the app. So you have to re-login with your account to see your passwords and folder.
- When you log out using the "Sign Out" button and log back in, you are redirected to the path you were on prior to logging out. Also, if you enter a specific route and you are not logged in, it redirects you to the login route and after logging in, it redirects you to the route you entered.
